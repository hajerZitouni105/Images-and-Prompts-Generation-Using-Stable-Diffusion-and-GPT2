## 1. Introduction
This project focuses on generating images based on textual prompts using state-of-the-art models: Stable Diffusion and GPT-2. It allows users to create images by entering manual commands and also generates a dataset of prompts for further exploration. This approach combines natural language processing and image generation techniques to create a versatile tool for generating visual content from textual descriptions.

## 2. Configure Parameters
After installing the libraries, configure the necessary parameters to set up the image generation environment. This may include specifying paths to models, defining image output settings, and adjusting any other relevant configurations.

## 3. Download Stable Diffusion 2 and GPT-2 Models
To utilize the image generation capabilities, you will need to download the Stable Diffusion 2 and GPT-2 models. Instructions for downloading and installing these models can be found in the respective documentation or links provided within the project.

## 4. Generate Images from Manual Commands
This section allows you to generate images by inputting manual commands. Experiment with different prompts to see how the models interpret your requests and create images accordingly.

## 5. Generate a Dataset of "Prompts"
In addition to manual image generation, this project also includes functionality to generate a dataset of prompts. This dataset can be used for batch processing or for further analysis of how different prompts influence image generation.

## 6. Display Images from the "Prompts" Dataset
Finally, you can display images generated from the prompts dataset. This allows you to visualize the results of the prompt generation process and evaluate the effectiveness of the models.

## Conclusion
This project serves as an introduction to image generation using advanced models like Stable Diffusion and GPT-2. It provides practical examples and hands-on experience in working with AI-generated content.
